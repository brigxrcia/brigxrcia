(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ Fancy seeing you here, I'm @brigxrcia! But you can call me Bri :P
♡ I'm currently an Undergraduate student at the University of Maryland majoring in Immersive Media Design with the intent of entering the Gaming Industry!
    
★ Immersive Media Design at UMD comes with two tracks, the B.S and B.A track. I'm completing the B.A track where it focuses on creative coding, digital design, and so much more.

♡ Here on my github, you can find the code from my previous classwork and projects, and soon to be personal projects!
